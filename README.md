# pTx-SPSP
This is a matlab toolbox for designing parallel transmit (pTx) spatial spectral (SPSP) RF pulses for high and ultra-high field MRI.
You may run the demo script, `demo.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design pTx SPSP pulses to create robust uniform water-selective excitation across the entire human brain at 7 Tesla. 
Our pulse design algorithm involves two-step optimization, with the optimization in step 1 relying on the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and being achieved using the code generously shared at https://cma-es.github.io/. 

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following paper:

### About the demo

You can use showPulse() to check the designed RF and Grad.

```matlab
showPulse(rf,grad,RF_duration,dt);
```

![fig1](results/fig1.JPG)

```matlab
offset = -100;%%% To see the robustness to off-resonance
%%% As in the paper, you may change offset to 0 and Â±100
showPerform(ID,rf,grad,dt, offset,RFA);
```

And use showPerform() to reproduce the water-excitation results. Shown are uniform water-excitation (left) and robust fat-suppression (right) at a -100Hz offset.

For further validation, use showFrequencyRes() to see the amazing frequency-responce curve!

```matlab
showFrequencyRes(ID,rf,grad,dt,RFA);
```
