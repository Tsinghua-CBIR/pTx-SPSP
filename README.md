# pTx-SPSP
This is a matlab toolbox for designing parallel transmit (pTx) spatial spectral (SPSP) RF pulses for high and ultra-high field MRI.
You may run the demo script, `demo.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design pTx SPSP pulses to create robust uniform water-selective excitation across the entire human brain at 7 Tesla. 
Our pulse design algorithm involves two-step optimization, with the optimization in step 1 relying on the CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and being achieved using the code generously shared at https://cma-es.github.io/. 

If you use the toolbox, please consider citing the following paper:

### About the demo

Set up training list and start your pTx-SPSP pulse design

```matlab
trainID = [1]; %%% serial number of calibration
%%% Tips: put more than one number here for universal pulse training;
%%% The universal pulse calculation is still under development for this open-source version right now.
RF_duration = 2.88e-3; %%% duration of the RF pulse, can not be changed the this version
dt = 10e-6; %%% dwell time, s, can not be changed in the demo
TR = 50e-3; %%% repetition time, s, used in SAR-constraint.
RFA = round(ernstAngle(TR)); %%% round: the vendor-provided FA is integer
[rf,grad,localSAR] = design_pTxSPSP_RF(trainID,RF_duration,dt,TR,RFA,'SPINS');
```

You can use showPulse() to check the designed RF and Grad.

```matlab
showPulse(rf,grad,RF_duration,dt);
```

```matlab
offset = -100;%%% To see the robustness to off-resonance
%%% As in the paper, you may change offset to 0 and Â±100
showPerform(ID,rf,grad,dt, offset,RFA);
```

And use showPerform() to reproduce the water-excitation results. Shown are uniform water-excitation (left) and robust fat-suppression (right) at a -100Hz offset.

For further validation, use showFrequencyRes() to see the amazing frequency-responce curve!

```matlab
showFrequencyRes(ID,rf,grad,dt,RFA);
```
